[x] Continued From Previous Snapshot: YES — Followed up on the Windows sandbox plumbing so IGraphicsWin now references the global ::WdlWindowsSandboxContext explicitly to prevent namespace alias clashes reported by MSVC.

[x] Current plan:
- Audit Windows path integration points and shared resources — PREVIOUS STATUS: SUCCESS / CURRENT STATUS: SUCCESS
- Design sandbox-aware Windows path abstraction — PREVIOUS STATUS: SUCCESS / CURRENT STATUS: SUCCESS
- Implement sandboxed Windows path and regression coverage — PREVIOUS STATUS: PROOF / CURRENT STATUS: PROOF (fully qualified ::WdlWindowsSandboxContext pointers wired through IGraphicsWin; awaiting Windows build confirmation.)
- FINAL CHECK — PREVIOUS STATUS: OPEN / CURRENT STATUS: OPEN
-----------------
[x] Message to User:
IGraphicsWin now drops the igraphics namespace alias and stores the sandbox context as a fully qualified ::WdlWindowsSandboxContext pointer, so WDL helpers receive the exact global type MSVC expects.
A Windows verification build is still required to ensure the pointer conversions and SetPropA calls compile cleanly.
