# AGENTS.md — Plan Protocol (Remote-Free, Git-Optional, Snapshot-Durable)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Commands

- /new-plan — Perform <Environment-Check> first, then create or overwrite the Current-Plan.xml in the workspace/`Repo-Name`/Plan/ Folder and create BASE-Snapshot
- /proceed — Execute next safe leaf tasks. If confidence < 0.90 or heuristics trigger, split first; parent waits. Batch work, update status/curcialInfo/tryCount, persist
- /edit-plan — Conversationally evolve the plan (no execution); apply edits; persist after each change.
- /delete-plan — Remove plan.

IF NONE OF ABOVE COMMANDS WAS GIVEN IGNORE THIS AGENTS.md FILE - RETURN.

## Coding Principles (always on)
- SOTA quality; SSOT; SoC; DRY; TDD bias; fail-fast; structured telemetry; deterministic builds.
- Centralized, per-module logging via a single root config (language-appropriate). That config defines module levels and log sinks/paths. All code logs through the central logger; no inline constants.

## Envrioment

- `plan_path`: workspace/`Repo-Name`/Plan/Current-Plan.xml
- `snapshot_path`:  workspace/`Repo-Name`/Plan/Snapshots/

## Plan Structure

<plan>
  <Goal>`Main-Goal`</Goal>
  <Environment-Check>
     Action: Verify toolchains/SDKs/drivers/env; run a smoke build/run appropriate to the project;  
      Acceptance: Environment supports building the repo.
      Rejection: Environment does not support building the repo.

     Set <Build-Test-Compatible> TRUE or FALSE.
  </Environment-Check>
  <Build-Test-Compatible>`TRUE` / `FALSE`</Build-Test-Compatible>
  <context>
    `Main-Goal Context`
  </context>
  <Tasks>
    <task>
      <name>`first task`</name>
      <status>OPEN | RETRY | UNFINISHED | AWAIT-CHILDREN-TASK-SUCCESS | PROOF | SUCCESS | AWAITS REVIEW | REVIEW PASSED</status>
      <tryCount>0</tryCount>
      <curcialInfo>
        `important information gathered`     
      </curcialInfo>
      <continue-info>
       'important information for the next agent to continue a interrupted task
      </continue-info>
      <sub-tasks>
        <task>
          [...]
        </task>
      </subtasks>
    </task>
        <task>
      <name>`n task`</name>
      <status>OPEN | RETRY | UNFINISHED | AWAIT-CHILDREN-TASK-SUCCESS | PROOF | SUCCESS | AWAITS REVIEW | REVIEW PASSED</status>
      <tryCount>0</tryCount>
      <curcialInfo>
        `important information gathered`     
      </curcialInfo>
      <continue-info>
         `precise resume data`: last completed step; next step(s); paths/files/lines; commands/flags; log anchors; snapshot_id (and commit hash if Git present); pending checks.
      </continue-info>
      <sub-tasks>
        <task>
          [...]
        </task>
      </subtasks>
    </task>
    [...]
  </Tasks>
</plan>

## Finalization (required last; two-pass “second arrival” defined)
    <task>
      <name>FINAL CHECK</name>
      <status>OPEN</status>
      <tryCount>0</tryCount>
      <curcialInfo>
        Action: Mark all tasks as AWAITS REVIEW. Mark this task as `FINAL-REVIEW-STARTED`. Go through all tasks and review with build-tests OR code-only-perspective-review 
        depending on  <Build-Test-Compatible>: TRUE OR FALSE. Set task to REVIEW PASSED if passed, OR Reopen tasks (+subtasks) that don't pass the review, then work on these until you can set their status AWAITS REVIEW again. this Action loops until all Tasks are marked REVIEW PASSED. 
        If all tasks are marked REVIEW PASSED mark this task as SUCCESS: Plan has succefully finished - Goal Achieved - Create Final PullRequest based on the whole Plan.
    </task>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Build Tests

  if <Environment-Check> TRUE: Obtain PROOF task status via build tests.
  else if <Environment-Check> FALSE: Obtain PROOF task status from code-viewing only (no build tests, code-only-perspective)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decomposition (short rules)
- Single-shot confidence threshold: 0.95. If below, split into subtasks before execution.
- Force split if: >2 files or >200 LOC; cross-module/API; concurrency/GPU/swapchain; new build/CI; missing acceptance/input; prior RETRY.
- Subtasks are first-class; parent waits. Limit nesting to 2 unless confidence remains < 0.95.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Evolving the Plan
If a Task in the Plan becomes outdated or wrong, then update the plan.
You are allowed to change and evolve / trim the plan based on the latest needs - if task(s) doesnt appear valid anymore based on new revelations edit the plan, so it stays valid.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Plan Summary  

(Before doing this always update plan - MANDATORY):
- create/overwrite `plan_path/Plan-Summary.md` with this: 

      ```
      [x] Continued From Previous Snapshot: `YES / NO` - `relevant 1-3 Lines Info` 
      -----------------
      [x] File Overview:
      - Num files Changed: N
      - Num Files created: N
      - Num Lines Modified: N

      [x]List of Files changed/created:
          - `<Path/Filename>`
          - `<Path/Filename>?`
          - `[...]`
      -----------------
      [x] Current plan:
      - <`Taskname` - PREVIOUS STATUS: `STATUS` / CURRENT STATUS: `STATUS`>
      - <`Taskname` - PREVIOUS STATUS: `STATUS` / CURRENT STATUS: `STATUS`>
      - <`Taskname` - PREVIOUS STATUS: `STATUS` / CURRENT STATUS: `STATUS`>
      - `[...]`

      [x] Message to User:
        <1-5 lines of text. you can freely choose what's relevant for the operator now and what you want to tell him>
      ```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Persistence Model
- Source of truth for continuity: **snapshots** under `snapshot_path`.
- At End of /proceed (and on timebox): create a compressed snapshot of the entire `workspace_root` (including hidden files) into `snapshot_path/<timestamp>.tgz`; write/update `latest_meta` with `{ snapshot_id, created_at, batch_summary, head_sha? }`.
- At Start of /proceed: if `workspace_root` is empty or reset, **restore** the latest snapshot into `workspace_root` before any work begins.
