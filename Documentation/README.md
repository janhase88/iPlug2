# Documentation

This is the home of documentation for iPlug2, which is a work in progress. The [iPlug 2 Wiki](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/wiki) includes some more high-level information, that may move here eventually.

If you're viewing this as a markdown file on GitHub, you can see the doxygen version [here](https://iplug2.github.io/docs/).

In the future, this will include some tutorials and guides, but for now it's just the doxygen docs for the classes. Most classes and files have been entered, but many methods are not yet documented, or are documented with out of date information. 

In the meantime, you can read two academic papers that we wrote about the project, which are in the documentation folder, and you can watch the accompanying presentations on YouTube:

2 - Web Audio Conference (WAC2018) [PAPER](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2/raw/master/Documentation/Papers/WAC2018.pdf) | [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/DDrgW4Qyz8Y)

See [Skia Vulkan on Windows](SkiaVulkanWindows.md) for instructions on enabling the Skia renderer with Vulkan on Windows.

## Windows and Skia header interoperability

When working on the Windows build with the Skia backend, always include
`IGraphics/Skia/SkTypefaceWinWrapper.h` instead of including Skia's
`SkTypeface_win.h` directly. The wrapper guarantees that `<windows.h>` is
included in a safe order and temporarily remaps the `LOGFONT` typedefs so the
Skia declarations cannot collide with the Windows definitions. Avoid
reintroducing ad-hoc `NOGDI` or `LOGFONT` macro workarounds elsewhereâ€”use the
wrapper instead to keep translation units consistent.

## Introduction

### Requirements
iPlug2 requires a compiler that supports C++14, and is tested with MS Visual Studio 2019 and Xcode 11. It is developed to target Windows 8 or higher and macOS 10.9+. If you wish to compile for older operating systems it may be possible, but will require adjusting some settings.
